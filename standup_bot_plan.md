# Goal

Make useful and convinient bot for our discrord server

# Current problems

* It has no storage
* It's really hard to configure 

# Ideas 

* Maybe !hr command which takes image and makes it high res
* Add "How much did you spend yesterday?" to standups questions
* Some stats 
* Analyze standup (ex. how many sleep probelms there were or how many weeks were solved in a single week)
* Add "How many task have you solved yesterday?"
