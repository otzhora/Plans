# Study plan

Goal: learn Data Science and become a better developer
<br/>
What to learn:

1. Data Science (classical machine learning, probability theory, neural networks, and Big Data)
2. Algorithms and Data Structures
3. DevOps (Docker, hosting, CI/CD)
4. python (advanced topics like asyncio, standard library)
5. improve typing speed

# Milestones

## Soft milestones

- finish intro to data science course from Yandex [X]
- finish Algorithmic toolbox [X]
- reach 70 wpm

## Medium milestones

- finish standup-bot
- Hands-on ml finished
- reach 80 wpm

## Hard milestones

- reach 90 wpm
- finish Andrew Ng specialization
- finish Data Structures and Algorithms specialization

## Final milestones

- find a job as a junior Data Scientist
- reach 100 wpm

## Removed milestones

- Finish courses on Big Data from Yandex - I've been told that on my level this is not a priority
