# Study plan

Goal: learn Data Science and become a better developer
What to learn: 
1) Data Science (classical machine learning, probability theory, neural networks, and Big Data) 
2) Algorithms and Data Structures 
3) DevOps (Docker, hosting, CI/CD)
4) python (advanced topics like asyncio, standard library)
5) improve typing speed
